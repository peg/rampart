# Rampart Standard Policy — default rules for common AI agent threats.
#
# IMPORTANT: Pattern matching limitations
# These rules use glob patterns against the literal command string.
# They protect against well-behaved AI agents, NOT adversarial humans.
# Evasion techniques like quoted binaries ('rm' -rf /), escaped chars
# (\rm -rf /), variable expansion ($CMD), or base64-encoded payloads
# will bypass glob matching. For adversarial threat models, combine
# Rampart with OS-level sandboxing (containers, seccomp, AppArmor).
#
# See docs/THREAT-MODEL.md for the full discussion.

#
# How it works:
#   - Claude Code: shows a native approval prompt
#   - MCP clients: blocks until resolved via API or dashboard
#   - OpenClaw: sends a chat message you can approve inline
#   - Webhooks: sends a notification with a signed approve/deny link
